## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Code is written to be easily modifiable with variables declared at the top of the file, such as the size of the grid and the speed of the snake. Event listeners and keyboardEvent key properties allow for user control while width and direction variables are calculated upon input to determine the direction of the snake. Touch button controls display on smaller screens.
